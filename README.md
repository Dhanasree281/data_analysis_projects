# 📊 DDS Company Sales Analysis (2014–2018)



## 📌 Problem Statement
DDS Company’s **2014–2018 sales performance** shows varying revenue and profit across products, channels, and regions.  
However, the business lacks a consolidated, data-driven view to:

- Identify **key revenue and profit drivers**  
- Uncover **seasonal trends and outliers**  
- Benchmark **channel performance and profitability**  
- Assess **regional concentration risk**  

Without these insights, DDS risks misaligned pricing, missed promotional opportunities, and uneven market expansion.  

**Objective:**  
Leverage historical sales data (2014–2018) to:  
- Pinpoint top-performing products, channels, and regions  
- Detect seasonality and anomalies in sales  
- Compare actual performance against budgets  
- Optimize **pricing, promotions, and market expansion**  

**Goal:**  
Enable DDS Company to achieve **sustainable growth**, diversify revenue, and reduce dependency on concentrated markets.
